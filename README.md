| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | ArrayData      | `int max()`: Return max value of array given when class constructed<br />`int min()`: Return min value of array given when class constructed |
| 2    | ThreeSum       | `int T_sum(int[] A)`: Return the numbers of combinations from array `A` which sums to 0 |
| 3    | IslandCounting | `int count(String[] A, String[] B)`: Return the numbers of island, given that for each node name from A and B represent a bridge which links two nodes that forms an island. |
| 4    | PCL            | `boolean checkPCL(int[][] array)`: Return whether there is any three dots from the given array could link to a stright line in 2-dimensions coordinate system. |
